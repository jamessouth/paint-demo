generative element backgrounds with css paint

with the new css paint api (aka houdini) we can use the full array of html canvas drawing methods (or at least a lot of them) to draw anything we want and use it in any CSS property that takes an image.  today i want to show how i used houdini in my newly rebuilt portfolio site to create generative border images and speech-bubble shaped divs.  i will cover using houdini with webpack and babel and how to get past all the snags i hit making the following demos.  note that i am not currently polyfilling houdini in my portfolio site so the css paint stuff will only work in chrome.

The basics of using houdini are the following:  for any css property that takes an image, such as background-image, put `paint(workletName)` as the value.  in a js file, create a class for your worklet.  at the bottom of the file, call the `registerPaint` method with the `workletName` and the class name.  then, in your main js, or since we're using webpack, our entry point, feature detect for `CSS.paintWorklet`.  if it's there, which right now is only in chrome, call  `CSS.paintWorklet.addModule('./myWorkletClassFile.js')`; otherwise, we can dynamically import the polyfill, then call `addModule`.
